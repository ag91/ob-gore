This lets Emacs Org Babel run Go snippets with the Gore Repl, which is
useful to do literate programming in Go (writing blog posts in my
case).

For now this only runs the command and retrieves everything as a
string, but I plan to slowly extend it to support common header
arguments (e.g., :var and :results).
